        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Hello, my name is Timothy Johnson. I began my Computer Science degree at SNHU in January 2024 and plan to graduate in October 2025. This portfolio highlights the enhancements I am planning for my work, showing how I will grow my skills and demonstrate readiness for the software development field.</p>
        <p>My career goal is to become a game developer. Gaming has been a lifelong passion of mine, and I want to take the problem-solving, design, and coding skills I’ve built through this program and apply them to create interactive and engaging experiences. As a father of three, I’m motivated to build a career in a field I’m passionate about while also setting an example of dedication and creativity for my kids.</p>

    <!-- Education Review Section -->
    <section id="education">
        <h2>Education Review</h2>
        <p>Throughout my coursework, I’ve worked with languages such as Java, Python, and C++ while gaining experience with development tools like Eclipse and Visual Studio. I’ve also learned how important it is to collaborate within agile teams, write clean and maintainable code, and use proper testing practices. These skills will support my transition into game development.</p>
        <p>Some key takeaways from my courses include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>CS 250:</strong> Gained experience with agile development, communication, and team roles.</li>
            <li><strong>CS 320:</strong> Practiced unit testing and software quality assurance techniques.</li>
            <li><strong>CS 360:</strong> Built a mobile inventory app that will serve as the foundation for my planned enhancements.</li>
            <li><strong>CS 340:</strong> Learned about client/server development, threading, and database management.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Together, these courses gave me the foundation for software engineering, algorithms and data structures, and databases—the three categories where I will make enhancements in this portfolio.</p>

    <!-- Enhancement Plan Section -->
    <section id="enhancements">
        <h2>Enhancement Plan</h2>

        <!-- Enhancement 1 -->
        <h3>Software Engineering & Design</h3>
        <p><strong>Planned Artifact:</strong> CS 360 Inventory App for managing 3D printing filament.</p>
        <p><strong>Planned Enhancement:</strong> I will refine the app’s user interface by improving the layout, spacing, and typography. I also plan to add custom icons (such as filament spools) and make the app more visually appealing and user-friendly.</p>

        <!-- Enhancement 2 -->
        <h3>Algorithms & Data Structures</h3>
        <p><strong>Planned Artifact:</strong> CS 360 Inventory App.</p>
        <p><strong>Planned Enhancement:</strong> I will implement a <code>FilamentManager</code> class that uses a HashMap for faster lookups, sorting, and validation. This will make the app more efficient and scalable, especially for larger inventories.</p>

        <!-- Enhancement 3 -->
        <h3>Databases</h3>
        <p><strong>Planned Artifact:</strong> CS 360 Inventory App.</p>
        <p><strong>Planned Enhancement:</strong> I will integrate an SQLite database to store spools, colors, and storage locations. I also plan to add functionality for exporting data to CSV and JSON formats, while ensuring sensitive information is handled securely.</p>

    <!-- Skills Section -->
    <section id="skills">
        <h2>Skills Demonstrated</h2>
        <p>Through my planned enhancements, I will demonstrate the following skills:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Separating UI, logic, and database code for easier maintenance.</li>
            <li>Using efficient data structures for faster lookups and organization.</li>
            <li>Planning unit testing and quality assurance strategies.</li>
            <li>Applying secure coding practices to protect data.</li>
            <li>Explaining technical design choices clearly to a wide audience.</li>
        </ul>
