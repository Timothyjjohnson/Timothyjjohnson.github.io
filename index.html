    <!-- Introduction -->
    <section id="introduction">
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Hello, my name is Timothy Johnson. I began my Computer Science degree at SNHU in January 2024 and plan to graduate in October 2025. This portfolio shows the enhancements Iâ€™ve made to demonstrate my growth and readiness for the software development field.</p>
        <p>My career goal is to become a game developer. Gaming has always been a passion of mine, and I want to apply my problem-solving, design, and coding skills to create interactive and engaging experiences. As a father of three, I am motivated to build a career doing something I enjoy while setting an example of dedication and creativity for my kids.</p>

    <!-- Enhancements -->
    <section id="enhancements">
        <h2>Enhancements</h2>
        <p>This portfolio focuses on three areas where I enhanced my work: software design, algorithms, and databases. Each enhancement includes the original artifact, the improved version, and a written narrative documenting the changes.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="software-design/enhanced/">Software Design & Engineering</a></li>
            <li><a href="algorithms/enhanced/">Algorithms & Data Structures</a></li>
            <li><a href="databases/enhanced/">Databases</a></li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <!-- Professional Journey -->
    <section id="journey">
        <h2>Professional Journey</h2>
        <p>Throughout my degree, I have built skills in software engineering, data structures, and database management. These enhancements show my ability to refine UI design, implement efficient algorithms, and work with secure databases. Together, they align with the five course outcomes by demonstrating modular design, problem-solving with algorithms, effective use of databases, software quality practices, and clear communication of technical ideas.</p>
